<!-- 
	Splice “in” signal with “splice_immediate_flag” set (this is the so called “signal abort” scenario).  Obviously we are not expecting to support the early return like TWC is wanting in phase 2 but we should make sure this doesn’t cause any errors with the current delete behavior.
	(Here binary data has splice_immediate_flag value is set. Any other binary data, QA was using before has this value unset.)
